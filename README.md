# myexpenses-app

This is a pet project with the double purpose of learning a little about developing an Android app and to make use of the project https://github.com/nataliobp/myexpenses-api-java.

Currently it is a simple app with a login screen, an expense list report screen and the features add, edit and remove an expense.
